# oh-my-claude

**Ship better real work with Claude Code — with less steering.**

*A frozen Definition of Excellent—deliberate, distinctive, coherent, visionary,
and complete—plus quality gates that block Claude from claiming "done" until
the work proves that bar, tests pass, and independent review clears the remaining
frontier. So you stop babysitting both correctness and ambition.*

## What changes after you install

Four outcomes you'll feel in your first week:

- **Claude can't claim "done" with broken code.** Quality gates intercept the Stop event until tests, review, and verification land. No more "I've made the changes" on work that doesn't compile.
- **Your prompts get classified before Claude acts.** Execution vs advisory, coding vs writing — and routed to the right specialists automatically. Less steering per turn; more useful first responses.
- **When Claude is uncertain, it tells you instead of guessing.** Declare-and-proceed openers surface the model's interpretation in one sentence so you can redirect cheaply if it's wrong — instead of finding out 3 commits later.
- **Claude no longer gets to invent the finish line after seeing what it built.** Serious `/ulw` work freezes a five-axis Definition of Excellent before mutation, records criterion-level artifact proof, and uses a fresh excellence reviewer to search for the strongest remaining move. “Visionary” is a blocking axis, not decorative praise.

The harness is bash hooks + skills + agents installed as an overlay into `~/.claude/`. It sits alongside Claude Code; Claude Code's own surface is unchanged.

### What this is NOT

- **Not a plugin framework or SDK** — no API, no extension model. Just hooks, skills, and agents.
- **Not Anthropic-affiliated** — community-built. Not the same project as `oh-my-claudecode` (separate Node-based tool).

## How is this different from vanilla Claude Code?

| | Vanilla Claude Code | oh-my-claude |
|---|---|---|
| **Quality enforcement** | None | Hard stop gates |
| **Definition of quality** | Whatever the active model decides late | Frozen before mutation; five task-specific axes + evidence + blind frontier |
| **Intent classification** | None | 5-category state machine |
| **Domain coverage** | Code-focused | Coding, writing, research, ops |
| **Dependencies** | — | bash + jq |
| **Agent safety** | Unrestricted | `disallowedTools` enforced |
| **Session continuity** | Lost on compaction | Pre/post-compact hooks |
| **Architecture** | Monolithic | Harness hooks |

## Quick start

Requires Claude Code 2.1.163+, `jq`, and `rsync`. macOS: `brew install jq` (`rsync` is preinstalled). Debian/Ubuntu: `apt install jq rsync`. `install.sh` hard-fails before mutation when Claude Code is older or `jq` is missing.

```bash
# Pinned install (recommended — install-remote.sh prints the current tag tip):
OMC_REF=v1.50.0 bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/X0x888/oh-my-claude/main/install-remote.sh)"

# Rolling install (tracks main HEAD — fine for trying things; pin a tag for prod):
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/X0x888/oh-my-claude/main/install-remote.sh | bash

# Verified remote install (tag pin + expected commit prefix before install.sh runs):
OMC_REF=v1.50.0 \
OMC_EXPECTED_SHA=<release-commit-sha-or-prefix> \
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/X0x888/oh-my-claude/main/install-remote.sh)"

# OR manual clone (audit before installing — strongest supply-chain posture):
git clone --branch v1.50.0 https://github.com/X0x888/oh-my-claude.git ~/.local/share/oh-my-claude
bash ~/.local/share/oh-my-claude/install.sh
```

The remote bootstrap path runs `verify.sh` automatically before it exits; a successful run should print `Errors: 0`.

<details>
<summary><b>Verified / hardened install</b> — supply-chain posture for the cautious (click to expand)</summary>

Re-running the same one-liner against an already-current canonical install verifies and exits without a reinstall when nothing changed; set `OMC_FORCE_REINSTALL=1` if you explicitly want to force `install.sh`. If you use the verified remote path, `OMC_EXPECTED_SHA` accepts any 7-40 char commit prefix and `install-remote.sh` refuses to run `install.sh` unless the cloned tree matches it. If you use the manual clone path above, run `bash ~/.local/share/oh-my-claude/verify.sh` yourself before restarting Claude Code.

Use the manual clone path when you want the strongest supply-chain posture. Use the verified remote path when you still want a one-liner but do not want to trust a tag name alone; copy the SHA from the GitHub release's `Verified bootstrap install` / `Trusted release commit` block and pass it via `OMC_EXPECTED_SHA`. That release body is the authoritative user-facing source for the trusted SHA. GitHub releases also ship attached source bundles (`oh-my-claude-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz`, `oh-my-claude-vX.Y.Z.zip`) plus `oh-my-claude-vX.Y.Z.SHA256SUMS` for checksum-based download verification, and the repo publishes GitHub artifact attestations for those assets so professional consumers can verify provenance with `gh attestation verify` or the bundled `tools/verify-published-release.sh` helper (full published-release audit, including optional attestation wait) after the release-attestation workflow completes. _Maintainers:_ release + distribution automation tooling (`tools/verify-*-readiness.sh`, surface staging, deployment-candidate prep, `--json` audit modes) lives in [Release & distribution tooling](#release--distribution-tooling-maintainers) below and [`CONTRIBUTING.md` § Release Process](CONTRIBUTING.md#release-process) — not part of the install path.

</details>

### Is this safe?

Fair question for a tool that hooks every prompt and runs bash on your machine. Short answers: **100% local** (no network egress, no telemetry endpoint — the only network activity is the `git clone` you invoke); **inspection/judgment agents cannot use Claude Code's direct editor tools** (all 26 deny `Write`, `Edit`, `MultiEdit`, and `NotebookEdit` and request plan mode; Bash remains available for inspection/tests and follows the active permission mode); **permission prompts stay on** (bypass is a separate explicit opt-in); **repo-owned oh-my-claude conf cannot flip protected flags** (the parser deny-lists them, while `verify.sh` separately checks Claude Code's user and current-project `disableAllHooks` settings); and **durable prompt-derived state is local and secret-redacted**. The closeout display never stores or replays accepted response text across streamed batches. `/omc-config` → Minimal turns optional telemetry off; operational gate state remains while a task is active. Claude Code project settings and administrator-managed policy can intentionally disable user hooks; that platform boundary is stated in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

After install, two mandatory steps:

1. **Restart Claude Code.** Hooks load at session start — `/ulw` silently no-ops in your current session until you restart.
2. **Try it**: `/ulw-demo` (about 90 seconds, fires the gates on a real edit), then `/ulw <your task>` for real work in any domain.

That's enough to feel the harness work. When you want more:
- **Configure** with `/omc-config` *inside Claude Code* — the default install is the **Balanced** profile (low-friction defaults; planning/review judgment inherits the session model, normal execution uses Sonnet, and genuinely tricky or uncertain specialist work escalates instead of paying for rework from an inferior model). For the strongest opinionated posture, run `/omc-config` and pick **Zero Steering** (quality model tier, all bias-defense directives, watchdog on, adaptive strict gates for high-risk work). Auto-detects first-time setup vs upgrade.
- **Verify on-disk install** with `bash ~/.local/share/oh-my-claude/verify.sh` from your terminal — useful when something feels off.

### When stuck — which deferral verb?

Three skills, three different "I can't keep going" cases. NOT interchangeable:

| Symptom | Verb |
|---|---|
| Gate fired but the work is genuinely complete (false positive) | `/ulw-skip <reason>` |
| Discovered-scope flagged real findings *(under ULW with default `no_defer_mode=on`: agent ships inline; opt out via `no_defer_mode=off` for legacy soft-defer)* | `/mark-deferred <named-WHY>` |
| Blocked on a real operational input — credentials, login, infra down, rate limit hit | `/ulw-pause <reason>` |

Escalation order before any of these fires (v1.40.0): ship inline → wave-append → reject-as-not-a-defect → pause-for-operational-block. Taste/policy/credible-approach calls are the agent's under ULW (`no_defer_mode=on`). The compact routing index in `~/.claude/quality-pack/memory/skills.md` is loaded into every session; it preserves this decision boundary and points to the relevant on-demand `SKILL.md` for detailed syntax and edge cases. The same catalog is surfaced via [`/skills`](#available-skills).

Both install paths keep Claude Code's permission prompts on; once you trust the harness, [`--bypass-permissions`](#power-user-setup) removes them. Quality gates apply either way.

Reversible: `bash ~/.local/share/oh-my-claude/uninstall.sh` removes the harness cleanly (timestamped backups and your user-owned Quality Constitution stay preserved). Use `--purge-quality-constitutions` only when you explicitly want that taste data erased.

Already in Claude Code and want to skip the manual steps? See [AI-assisted install](#ai-assisted-install) below.

## AI-assisted install

Already in Claude Code? Paste one of these prompts directly. Each is self-contained, but the canonical step-by-step lives in the cloned repo's [`AGENTS.md` § "Agent Install Protocol"](AGENTS.md#agent-install-protocol--installing-or-updating-oh-my-claude) — the prompts point there so the README and the protocol don't drift.

**First-time install:**

> Install oh-my-claude. Do these in order:
> 1. Clone `https://github.com/X0x888/oh-my-claude.git` into `~/.local/share/oh-my-claude` (canonical path — matches the curl-pipe-bash bootstrapper).
> 2. Read `~/.local/share/oh-my-claude/AGENTS.md` § "Agent Install Protocol" and follow it end-to-end.
> 3. Use `--model-tier=balanced` (don't ask me).
> 4. After `verify.sh` passes, quote its "What next?" footer back to me verbatim — do not paraphrase.
> 5. Tell me explicitly to restart Claude Code and run `/ulw-demo` in the new session. Hooks won't fire in this current session.
> 6. If the protocol finds an existing install, ask whether I mean reinstall or update. If the canonical clone path belongs to another repo, or if `install.sh` / `verify.sh` fails, stop and show me the issue instead of forcing ahead.
> 7. If I explicitly ask for the curl-pipe-bash route instead of a manual clone, use the tag-pinned `install-remote.sh` path with `OMC_EXPECTED_SHA=<trusted release commit sha/prefix>` rather than rolling `main`, and source that SHA from the GitHub release's `Verified bootstrap install` / `Trusted release commit` block.

**Update an existing install:**

> Update oh-my-claude. Read `repo_path=` from `~/.claude/oh-my-claude.conf`, then follow `<repo_path>/AGENTS.md` § "Agent Install Protocol" → Step 2 (Update). After running `install.sh` and `verify.sh`, use the helper-backed update summary from the protocol and tell me whether to restart Claude Code only if the helper says it is required. If `verify.sh` fails, stop and show me the output; do not give restart advice or the `What next?` footer.

## Updating an existing install

```bash
cd ~/.local/share/oh-my-claude     # or your repo_path from ~/.claude/oh-my-claude.conf
git pull && bash install.sh
bash verify.sh
```

Restart Claude Code only when the install outcome says it is required; the `install.sh` post-install summary now tells you directly, still lists orphans if files were removed, and for real updates prints a standardized summary with prior/current install refs plus commits since the previous installed SHA.

Prefer the one-liner update path? Re-running `install-remote.sh` against the canonical clone now fast-paths the already-current case: it verifies the live install and exits without reinstalling when the repo and installed bundle are already in sync. When it does perform a real update, it now prints an update summary with the prior/current install refs, restart decision, and commits since the prior installed SHA. Set `OMC_FORCE_REINSTALL=1` to bypass the already-current guard.

Need a machine-readable preflight or post-update summary? `bash ~/.local/share/oh-my-claude/tools/install-state-report.sh --json` refreshes `origin` and reports `installed_version`, `latest_tag`, `last_install_at`, whether the clone is already current, the last install's `restart_required` decision, and the installer-recorded previous/current refs plus commit summary for the last update. For standardized human-facing text, the same helper exposes `--already-current-summary`, `--last-update-summary`, and `--restart-guidance`; those are the canonical lines consumed by `install-remote.sh`, `install.sh`, and `verify.sh`.

Your `--model-tier` preference persists in `~/.claude/oh-my-claude.conf` and re-applies automatically. The statusline shows a yellow `↑v<version>` arrow when the source repo is ahead of the installed bundle — re-run `install.sh` to sync.

`install.sh` overwrites bundled files but preserves `settings.json` merges, `omc-user/overrides.md`, and custom agents or skills whose names are outside the bundle. Hand-edited files in `quality-pack/memory/` get a pre-rsync warning so you can migrate edits to `omc-user/overrides.md` before they're overwritten. See FAQ: [*How do I update?*](docs/faq.md#how-do-i-update-oh-my-claude) and [*Will updating overwrite my changes?*](docs/faq.md#will-updating-overwrite-my-changes) for the full safety matrix.

**Install flags (v1.36.0+):**
- `--no-ghostty` / `--with-ghostty` — skip or force-install Ghostty theme/config. Default auto-detects: only seeds `~/.config/ghostty/` when that directory already exists.
- `--keep-backups=N` (default `10`) — prune older `oh-my-claude-*` backup directories after install. `--keep-backups=all` disables pruning. Closes the unbounded-accumulation surface during patch cascades.

Reversible: `bash ~/.local/share/oh-my-claude/uninstall.sh` removes everything cleanly. Backups of pre-install settings live at `~/.claude/backups/oh-my-claude-<timestamp>/` (auto-pruned per `--keep-backups`; the most recent always survives).

## Troubleshooting

The first 60 seconds of common failure modes:

| Symptom | First check |
|---|---|
| `install.sh` exits with `jq: command not found` | Install `jq` first (`brew install jq` on macOS, `apt install jq` on Debian/Ubuntu) and re-run `install.sh`. |
| `install-remote.sh` exits with `missing required command: ...` | Install the named prerequisite and re-run the bootstrapper. For `jq`, the bootstrapper may offer an auto-install on supported systems; otherwise use your package manager. |
| `install-remote.sh` says `Refusing to run the wrong installer` | The target clone path already points at a different repo. Move/remove that checkout, or re-run with `OMC_SRC_DIR=<different path>` if you intentionally want to keep both. |
| `install-remote.sh` says `post-install verification failed` | The source repo is still on disk. Fix the verifier errors shown above, then re-run the printed `verify.sh` path (or `install.sh` if you changed bundled files) instead of recloning. |
| `verify.sh` reports errors | Re-run `bash install.sh`, then `verify.sh` again. Most failures are stale install or missing `jq`/`rsync`. |
| `/ulw` does nothing in your current session | You skipped the **restart Claude Code** step. Already-running sessions keep the previous hook wiring — open a new session. |
| `/ulw-demo` doesn't block at Step 3 | Install is stale (re-run `bash install.sh`) or `/ulw-off` was called earlier in the session. |
| Hooks fire but no behavior changes | Same root cause as the "current session" row above — restart needed. |
| Yellow `↑v<version>` arrow in the statusline | Source repo is ahead of the installed bundle. Run `git pull && bash install.sh` from the source repo to sync. |

For deeper issues, see [FAQ](docs/faq.md) — anomaly logs, config recovery, and per-gate disabling are documented there.

## The problem

Claude Code is powerful, but out of the box it cuts corners in predictable ways:

- **It writes code but doesn't test it.** You get a diff that looks right, breaks in practice, and you're the one who finds out.
- **It stops before work is actually done.** "I've made the changes" -- but there's no review, no verification, no evidence it works.
- **It defers unfinished work to "a future session."** Wave 1 done, Wave 2 is next. Except Wave 2 never happens.
- **It gives surface-level advice without reading actual code.** Generic patterns instead of grounded analysis of what's in front of it.
- **It chains tool calls without thinking between them.** Mechanical sequences that look productive but skip the reasoning that catches mistakes.
- **It only works well for coding.** Ask it to write a proposal, research a decision, or plan an initiative and it falls back to code-shaped workflows.

These aren't edge cases. They're the daily experience of anyone using Claude Code for real work.

## What oh-my-claude does

oh-my-claude enforces cognitive quality through structure, not prompt engineering. Instead of asking Claude to please think harder, it installs bash hooks that intercept Claude Code's lifecycle events -- prompt submission, session compaction, stop attempts -- and injects domain-aware context, quality requirements, and hard gates that Claude cannot bypass.

The result: Claude classifies your intent before acting, routes work to specialist agents, can require a fresh-context specialist before implementation when the opt-in agent-first gate is enabled, thinks between tool calls, and blocks initial completion attempts while active review or verification gates are unresolved. If a safety cap is exhausted, the unresolved gap is surfaced instead of trapping the session indefinitely.

## Feature highlights

### Hard quality gates

**Missing verification or review blocks completion attempts.** Skip tests, skip the generic reviewer for an edited code/prose surface, defer work to a "future session" without a checkpoint, miss prompt-stated commit/push obligations, or leave a semantically required specialist review uncovered — each initially hard-stops completion. Caps prevent infinite loops: if Claude cannot satisfy a gate, it eventually surfaces the unresolved gap instead of spinning.

### Definition of Excellent: a finish line Claude cannot move

**Serious work now establishes the quality bar before implementation, not after it.** With `definition_of_excellent=adaptive` (default), medium/high-risk, broad, open-mandate, Zero-Steering, and explicitly ambitious prompts arm a causal protocol:

1. `quality-planner` or `prometheus` freezes 5–10 falsifiable criteria for what must feel **deliberate, distinctive, coherent, visionary, and complete**. PreToolUse blocks mutation until the harness validates and binds that contract to the exact objective, review cycle, planner identity, and plan revision.
2. The implementation and verification produce target-bound, artifact-grounded receipts against those frozen criteria. Each criterion consumes exactly one receipt that uniquely matches it; multiple independent proofs become separately anchored criteria, and a combined receipt matching several criteria proves none. Scope-expanding continuations and replans invalidate stale proof; after mutation, an additive contract revision may strengthen the floor but cannot rewrite the north star/axes or delete or weaken any frozen criterion, standard, or anti-goal.
3. A fresh `excellence-reviewer` searches alternatives blind-first, assesses every criterion, and publishes the strongest remaining frontier. A material frontier is `FINDINGS`, not a footnote; cost, time, and difficulty alone cannot clear it.
4. Stop recomputes the whole chain from authoritative sidecars. There is no model-controlled retry cap: release needs a current contract, all mandatory proof, and a strong clear frontier. The explicit user escapes remain `/ulw-skip <reason>` or `definition_of_excellent=off`.

The visionary axis means a coherent, recoverable, evidence-testable step-change in the user's outcome—not novelty theater or unrelated scope. A deliberately restrained design can be visionary when it unlocks the better operating model. The optional user-owned Quality Constitution (`/quality-constitution`) stores explicit standards and annotated exemplars under `~/.claude/omc-user/`; repositories and model prose cannot silently promote preferences into blocking rules. See [`docs/definition-of-excellent.md`](docs/definition-of-excellent.md) for the protocol and falsifiable blind A/B evaluation contract.

**Evidence status:** the enforcement mechanism and blind evaluator are implemented, but the preregistered paid A/B campaign has not run. Measured superiority over the exact pre-feature harness remains pending.

### Agent-first execution

**Opt-in (v1.43+).** When `agent_first_gate=on`, `/ulw` execution requires Claude to dispatch and wait for a fresh-context shaping specialist before the first workspace mutation — read-only inspection still works, but `Edit`/`Write`/`MultiEdit`/`NotebookEdit` and common mutating Bash commands block until a planner, domain specialist, challenge agent, researcher, writer, or lens has returned. Post-hoc reviewers do not satisfy this floor.

**Default is `off`** because the mandate was firing ~2.2x/session while live routing is risk-adaptive and inherited specialists ride the user's temporary/current session model; the harness cannot promise that a mandatory first specialist is categorically smarter than the main thread. The depth-on-every-prompt rule + sub-dispatch-as-tool guidance in `~/.claude/quality-pack/memory/model-robustness.md` now carry the actual concern. Turn it on via `/omc-config` when training a new workflow habit, when you explicitly want an independent fresh-context checkpoint before mutation regardless of model ordering, or when the active session is drift-prone on a single surface. First-mutation telemetry remains available in both modes: exact editor attempts are stamped PreTool, while default-off Bash is stamped after an actual mutation is observed; the block counter increments only when the enabled gate blocks.

### Adaptive review coverage

**Review follows the current objective's edited surfaces and semantic risk, not a standing file-count chain.** Generic code quality and prose review remain universal for their respective surfaces. The stop-hook adds specialist dimensions only when they apply:

- `quality-reviewer` — bug hunt, code quality
- `design-reviewer` — design quality when a current-objective UI-shaped edit is paired with UI/visual intent or broader complex/active-wave scope (web plus high-confidence Apple and Android UI paths)
- `excellence-reviewer` — completeness for broad/open, cross-surface-at-threshold, current-complex-plan, active Phase 8 wave-plan, or unknown-scope work
- `editor-critic` — doc clarity and accuracy
- `briefing-analyst` — traceability for sufficiently broad cross-surface or active-wave changes

Metis stays where its competence belongs: plan-phase pressure testing, optionally enforced by `metis_on_plan_gate`, rather than being forced after an arbitrary number of edited files. Each gate block message names the missing coverage and its best reviewer. A `VERDICT: CLEAN|SHIP|FINDINGS (N)` line tells the hook whether that reviewer's own dimension was ticked; specialist clocks cannot satisfy or erase the generic review. Reviewer dispatches and Bash/MCP verification calls snapshot the relevant code/plan generation at start; an edit that lands while either is in flight makes that result stale instead of letting completion time relabel old evidence as current. A fresh-objective edit-log boundary prevents earlier work from inflating the current review, and each dimension follows its relevant code, document, UI, aggregate edit, or plan revision. UI-looking files do not create a design tax on a new logic-only objective: visual/UI semantics, explicit breadth, a current complex plan, or an active Phase 8 wave must also make design judgment material. Source-form writing and research files (`.tex`, `.bib`, `.typ`, `.qmd`, `.rmd`) route with prose. Doc-only edits route straight to `editor-critic` and skip the code-verification gate, so fixing a typo in CHANGELOG doesn't re-trigger `npm test`.

### Intent classification

**Every prompt is classified by intent and domain before Claude acts.** Five intent categories (execution, continuation, advisory, checkpoint, session-management) crossed with six domains (coding, writing, research, operations, mixed, general). Advisory questions get answered directly; execution prompts get the full specialist pipeline. A **prompt-text trust override** in the PreTool guard re-reads the user's prompt when the classifier disagrees, so destructive ops the prompt clearly authorized aren't blocked by mis-routing.

Five **bias-defense directive layers** (conf-gated) defend against under- and over-interpretation: `prometheus_suggest` and `intent_verify_directive` (declare-and-proceed on short unanchored prompts); `exemplifying_directive` (treat example-marked items as one of a class, enumerate siblings); `intent_broadening` (project-surface inventory reference so a prompt that names some surfaces doesn't silently miss the rest); `divergence_directive` (enumerate 2-3 paradigm framings inline before committing on shape-decisions). All compose under `directive_budget` (`balanced` default): a registry and whole-payload ceiling trim lower-priority repetition, while mandatory safety/gate and explicitly triggered Council/UI/model contracts emit fail-safe. Stable routing frames collapse to a compact delta until behavior changes, compact/resume fires, or the TTL expires. `quality_policy=zero_steering` adds adaptive strictness for users who want minimal-prompt autonomous shipping: high-risk work keeps blocking until proof is green, while small work stays compact. ULW's default `no_defer_mode=on` also keeps serious missing work blocking after gate caps, so complex tasks cannot end by scorecard-release, narrowed scope, or future-session handoff. Hard backstops: `exemplifying_scope_gate` blocks Stop until each enumerated sibling is marked shipped or consciously declined. Per-flag detail and tuning lives in [`docs/customization.md`](docs/customization.md).

Reviewer findings are machine-readable (single-line `FINDINGS_JSON` block before each VERDICT). Hot-path hook latency is budgeted in `check-latency-budgets.sh` so speed regressions surface before merge.

### Multi-domain routing

**Each domain has its own specialist chain — not a coding tool that happens to accept prose.**

- **Coding** -- quality-planner for scoping, quality-researcher for context, specialist developers (frontend, backend, fullstack, iOS, DevOps, test), universal quality-reviewer plus surface/semantic reviewers when applicable
- **Writing** -- writing-architect for structure, draft-writer for content, editor-critic for polish
- **Research** -- librarian for source gathering, briefing-analyst for synthesis, metis for stress-testing conclusions
- **Operations** -- chief-of-staff turns vague asks into structured deliverables, action plans, and decision memos

### Session continuity

**Objectives, decisions, review state, and the done-contract survive context compaction — you don't lose the plot mid-task.** Pre- and post-compact hooks snapshot the working state. Domain classification, accepted decisions, specialist conclusions, in-flight dispatches, pending review obligations, and the remaining contract obligations all carry over. When the session resumes, context is rehydrated — not reconstructed from scratch.

### Permissioned agents

**37 specialist agents — 26 are configured for inspection/judgment; the 11 that build retain editor tools.** The 26 inspection/judgment specialists carry `disallowedTools: Write, Edit, MultiEdit, NotebookEdit` plus `permissionMode: plan`: they cannot invoke Claude Code's direct file/notebook editors. Bash remains available because inspection and verification need `git diff`, targeted tests, and build checks; it is not an OS-level no-write sandbox and remains governed by the active Claude Code permission mode (parent `acceptEdits`, `auto`, or bypass modes can take precedence). The 11 domain builders (frontend-developer, backend-api-developer, the ios-* family, fullstack-feature-builder, devops-infrastructure-engineer, test-automation-engineer, research-data-analyst, atlas) retain editor tools by design, under that same permission model.

### Walk-away goals (`omc` CLI)

**Fire an ambitious goal from a bare shell prompt and come back to finished, verified work — no Claude Code session left open.** `omc "make the error handling in this module actually robust"` derives the acceptance criteria a senior would insist on, runs `/ulw`-armed headless work passes (the full ambient harness — routing, gates, reviewer chain — rides along inside every pass), verifies each criterion on ground truth (mechanical checks run for real; judgment criteria get a fresh read-only critic), and only declares done after a skeptical final diff review comes back clean. Cost- and iteration-capped, git-required by default, honest ✅/❌ close with evidence per criterion, and every run records to `omc runs` for later inspection. Installed at `~/.claude/bin/omc` (symlinked into `~/.local/bin` when present).

### Project Council

**Solo developers get the right cross-functional perspective without paying for a standing panel.** `/council` first maps the coverage the question actually needs, considers the full specialist roster, and records why relevant perspectives were included or skipped. It dispatches the smallest sufficient primary team concurrently — normally one to four agents, with one valid for a narrow specialist audit; a larger team is allowed only when the ledger records the cost and every independent high-impact competence need. The locked coverage lifecycle starts primary-only, records exact-objective returns, requires row-by-row reconciliation before it can add up to two gap-fill specialists, and refuses to mark the assessment ready until every selected round has returned and final reconciliation exists. Namespaced identities match exactly; unnamespaced installed names bind once, preventing same-short-name plugins from borrowing each other's mandate. The `[council:primary]`, `[council:gap-fill]`, and `[council:verification]` prefixes are phase/provenance tags, not agent-name templates or a fixed cast. Up to three load-bearing findings are checked by independent, competence-matched verifiers. `--polish` and `--self-audit` bias the coverage map rather than forcing named rosters; `--deep` escalates selected Sonnet-backed agents without downgrading agents that inherit a stronger main model. A request that explicitly names a tricky/intermittent/unknown-root-cause uncertainty auto-enables that depth and includes one best-fit inherited deliberator, so users do not need to know the flag and the harness does not pay for repeated inferior attempts. Generic breadth or high risk alone does not. Broad prompts such as "evaluate my project" still auto-trigger under `/ulw`; a focused feature, capability, surface, or subsystem does not automatically inflate into a whole-project council.

Assessment and implementation are separate decisions. Only a successfully completed, fully reconciled advisory Council arms a handoff, and only the immediately following matching prompt—such as “implement the recommendations”—can consume it; an intervening prompt expires it. Bare `implement` or `ship` authorizes execution of the assessed scope. Full-scope expansion follows the canonical `is_exhaustive_authorization_request()` predicate: explicit all/every/everything forms, exhaustive implementation wording, a high-bar target, or binary-quality framing can authorize it; thorough assessment wording alone cannot. Otherwise the normal scope-expansion pause applies.

### Distinctive UI by default

**Ask for a landing page or semantically visual/UI work and you get a 9-section Design Contract — palette with hex values, typography rules, component states, layout, depth, do's & don'ts — before UI code is written.** Concrete commitments instead of generic shadcn-default aesthetics. Scope-aware: a "build a page" prompt gets the full contract; a "fix the button padding" prompt preserves existing tokens; a logic-only edit in a UI-shaped file does not automatically turn into a redesign. Skip with `no design polish` for backend/internal work.

15 brand archetypes (Linear, Stripe, Vercel, Notion, Apple, Airbnb, Spotify, Tesla, Figma, Discord, Raycast, Anthropic, Webflow, Mintlify, Supabase) are framed as *anti-anchors* — the agent picks a coherent starting point and commits to what it will do *differently*. Cross-session archetype memory prevents the same anchor from being picked twice on the same project. Inline contract emission lets `design-reviewer` and `visual-craft-lens` grade drift even when no `DESIGN.md` exists at the project root. Inspired by [VoltAgent/awesome-design-md](https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-design-md).

### Zero dependencies

**No npm. No TypeScript. No Node.js runtime. No plugin framework.** The entire harness is bash scripts and `jq`. It works anywhere Claude Code runs, installs in seconds, and leaves no footprint beyond the `~/.claude/` directory.

## Usage examples

**Coding**
```
/ulw debug why settings saves but shows stale data until refresh
```

**Writing**
```
ulw draft a project proposal for an AI-assisted research workflow
```

**Research**
```
/ulw compare server-session auth vs JWT and recommend one
```

**Operations**
```
ulw turn these meeting notes into an action plan and follow-up email
```

**Project evaluation**
```
/council
/ulw evaluate my project and plan for improvements
```

## How it works

When you submit a prompt, the intent router (`prompt-intent-router.sh`) classifies it by intent category and domain, then injects the appropriate context and specialist instructions into Claude's working memory. Claude processes the task using the routed specialist agents -- each scoped to its domain and constrained by permission boundaries. After likely terminal evidence, a hidden PostToolBatch preflight runs the real quality guard against isolated shadow state. If work is incomplete, Claude receives the exact recovery privately and keeps working without printing a provisional final; when the generation is READY, it receives one bounded cumulative manifest and writes one complete replacement summary.

Before READY, `MessageDisplay` leaves ordinary progress untouched but replaces a completion-shaped streamed message with one compact checking-gates marker and suppresses the rest of that message. After READY, every response batch passes through byte-for-byte; the single Stop dispatcher performs the exact live validation and sequences guard → timing → canary → archive deterministically. A clean close gets the compact `✓ oh-my-claude · quality checks passed` receipt; a platform-cap or configured scorecard release is explicitly labeled and preserves a bounded uncertified candidate instead of hiding the user's details.

The core state machine (`common.sh`) handles intent classification, domain scoring, session state tracking, and the quality gate logic. All state is managed in bash -- no external services, no databases, no background processes.

> **Why `dot-claude` instead of `.claude`?** Claude Code's permission system treats paths containing `.claude/` as sensitive, triggering prompts on every edit during development. The installer copies `bundle/dot-claude/` into `~/.claude/` on your machine. Same pattern as oh-my-zsh, chezmoi, etc.

### Available skills

Skills are invoked as slash commands or routed automatically by the intent classifier.

| Skill (mnemonic) | Command | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Run a task** | | |
| ulw | `/ulw <task>` | Maximum-autonomy professional workflow |
| goal *(relentless drive)* | `/goal <objective>` | Persistent goal driven relentlessly across turns until verifiably achieved or a no-progress stuck-wall (Codex `/goal` port). Activates the full ULW harness itself (single entrance, v1.47) — and you usually don't need it: a `/ulw` prompt with an explicit goal declaration ("don't stop until tests pass") auto-arms the same driver (`goal_auto_arm`). Lifecycle: pause/resume/clear/done. |
| **Think before acting** | | |
| plan-hard *(plan)* | `/plan-hard <task>` | Decision-complete planning without edits |
| prometheus *(interview)* | `/prometheus <goal>` | Interview-first planning for ambiguous work |
| metis *(stress-test)* | `/metis <plan>` | Pressure-test a plan for hidden risks |
| oracle *(second opinion)* | `/oracle <issue>` | Deep debugging or architecture second opinion |
| diverge *(expand option space)* | `/diverge <task>` | Generate 3-5 alternative framings BEFORE commit (v1.31.0; upstream of convergent critics). v1.32.0: also auto-suggested under `/ulw` on paradigm-shape prompts via the `divergence_directive` (X-vs-Y, "how should we", "best way to model X", etc.) — inline 2-3 framings is the default; explicit `/diverge` is the escalation. |
| librarian *(docs lookup)* | `/librarian <topic>` | Official docs and reference research |
| **Review & evaluate** | | |
| review-hard *(review)* | `/review-hard [focus]` | Findings-first code review |
| test-audit *(test portfolio)* | `/test-audit [scope] [--apply]` | Decide which tests to keep, extend, merge, replace, retire, or add by unique behavioral confidence, runtime, stability, and maintenance cost. Read-only unless `--apply` is explicit. |
| research-hard *(research)* | `/research-hard <topic>` | Targeted context gathering |
| council *(adaptive evaluation)* | `/council [focus] [--deep]` | Coverage-map-driven evaluation from the full agent roster: normally 1–4 concurrent primary specialists (larger only for evidenced independent needs), optional 0–2 gap-fill, and competence-matched verification of up to 3 findings. A same-turn request or the immediate follow-up to a completed assessment can enter **Phase 8**; exhaustive scope still requires explicit authorization. `--deep` escalates selected Sonnet-backed agents only; explicit tricky/intermittent/unknown-root-cause uncertainty auto-enables it and requires one inherited deliberator. |
| **Build** | | |
| frontend-design *(visual craft)* | `/frontend-design <task>` | Distinctive design-first frontend work |
| **Research & science** | | |
| data-analysis *(scientific analysis)* | `/data-analysis <task>` | Experimental data analysis to peer-review standard — fitting with honest uncertainties, provenance run-manifests, publication figures checked against journal specs (backed by the `research-data-analyst` agent + `research-craft/` doctrine) |
| lit-review *(verified literature)* | `/lit-review <topic>` | Academic literature review where every source is registry-verified (Crossref/OpenAlex/Semantic Scholar/arXiv) before it is returned — the `literature-scout` agent never cites from model memory |
| manuscript *(papers & theses)* | `/manuscript <task>` | Academic writing workflow: structure (writing-architect) → verified citations (literature-scout) → draft (draft-writer) → prose + rigor critique (editor-critic, rigor-reviewer). Includes referee-response mode |
| swiftui-pro *(SwiftUI review, model-invoked)* | *(no slash command — auto-fires on SwiftUI work)* | Comprehensive SwiftUI review: modern API usage (`foregroundStyle` not `foregroundColor`, `Tab` not `tabItem()`, etc.), accessibility, data flow, navigation, design, performance, Swift idioms, hygiene. Partial-load via topic-scoped requests. Vendored from [`twostraws/SwiftUI-Agent-Skill`](https://github.com/twostraws/SwiftUI-Agent-Skill) v1.1 (MIT, Paul Hudson). |
| gamedev *(game-dev review, model-invoked)* | *(no slash command — auto-fires on Unity/Godot/web game work)* | Engine-idiomatic review + guidance for Unity (C#), Godot (GDScript/C#), and web engines (Phaser/Babylon/PixiJS/Three.js): frame-budget perf, update-loop hygiene, object pooling, and the frame-grounded run→capture→evaluate→fix loop. Per-engine partial-load references; recommends Unity MCP / Godot MCP / [godogen](https://github.com/htdt/godogen). Original (not vendored). |
| atlas *(repo bootstrap)* | `/atlas [focus]` | Bootstrap or refresh repo instruction files |
| **Configure** | | |
| omc-config *(setup walkthrough)* | `/omc-config [setup\|update\|change]` | Multi-choice walkthrough for `oh-my-claude.conf` flags. Auto-detects first-time setup vs upgrade vs ad-hoc change. Picks a profile (Zero Steering / Balanced / Minimal) or fine-tunes individual flags—including the Definition arming mode, Constitution, taste learning, and its prompt budget—without typing. Triggered by phrases like "help me install", "configure oh-my-claude", "update my settings". |
| quality-constitution *(taste authority)* | `/quality-constitution [show\|remember\|must\|must-not\|avoid\|review\|accept\|reject\|reference\|anti-reference\|remove\|audit]` | Inspect and curate explicit project quality principles, signatures, anti-patterns, and annotated exemplars. Mutations use one-use exact-prompt grants; changed repository exemplars are quarantined and invalidate frozen quality contracts. User-owned data survives updates/uninstall; inferred candidates are advisory until you approve them. |
| **Workflow control** (mid-session) | | |
| ulw-demo *(onboarding)* | `/ulw-demo` | Guided walkthrough with real quality gates |
| ulw-status *(diagnostics)* | `/ulw-status` | Show current session state, the persisted done-contract, live Definition-of-Excellent contract/proof/frontier/weakest axis, remaining obligations, Council Phase 8 wave-plan progress, and timing/token/directive totals. Its compact summary includes token/cache totals and top role/model economics drivers. `summary` / `classifier` arguments swap modes. |
| ulw-time *(time + token distribution)* | `/ulw-time [current\|last\|last-prompt\|week\|month\|all]` | Polished end-of-turn card — stacked top bar (`█` agents · `▒` tools · `░` idle), per-bucket chart, input/output/cache + agent-token share, and a one-line insight. The same card auto-emits as Stop `systemMessage` above the 5s display floor; blocked and shorter token-bearing turns are still checkpointed. Manual invocations slice a different window or bypass the floor. |
| ulw-report *(retrospective)* | `/ulw-report [last\|week\|month\|all]` | Markdown digest of cross-session activity — sessions, gate fires, bias-defense fires, router directive footprint, token economics by role/model/native dispatch, stale-review cost, top reviewers, classifier misfires, Serendipity catches, and finding/wave outcomes |
| memory-audit *(memory hygiene)* | `/memory-audit [--memory-dir <path>]` | Classify MEMORY.md entries (load-bearing, archival, superseded, drifted) and propose rollup moves. Read-only. |
| whats-new *(changelog delta)* | `/whats-new` | Show CHANGELOG entries between your installed version and the source repo HEAD. Surfaces post-install features without `cat CHANGELOG.md`. (v1.36.x) |
| omc-doctor *(install health)* | `/omc-doctor` | One-shot install health check against the installed `~/.claude` tree — core files, CLAUDE.md @-includes, hook wiring, state-root writability — from any directory, no source clone needed. Claude Code fails open on hook errors, so a broken install is silently inert; this makes it visible. (v1.48) |
| ulw-skip *(skip a gate)* | `/ulw-skip <reason>` | Skip current quality gate block once |
| ulw-correct *(fix a misclassification)* | `/ulw-correct <correction>` | Tell the harness "the last turn was misclassified" — records the misfire and updates intent/domain when parseable. (v1.40.x) |
| mark-deferred *(triage findings)* | `/mark-deferred <reason>` | Bulk-defer pending discovered-scope findings with a one-line reason — legacy soft-defer path. **Refused under ULW execution with default `no_defer_mode=on`** (v1.40.0); the agent ships inline, wave-appends, or rejects as not-a-defect instead. Opt out via `no_defer_mode=off` for the v1.39 behavior |
| ulw-pause *(operational-block pause)* | `/ulw-pause <reason>` | Declare an operational block — credentials/login, hard external blocker, destructive shared-state action, unfamiliar in-progress state. NOT for taste/policy/credible-approach (v1.40.0: agent owns those under ULW). Cap 2/session |
| ulw-resume *(post-rate-limit recovery)* | `/ulw-resume [--peek \| --list \| --session-id <sid> \| --dismiss]` | Atomically claim and replay the most relevant unclaimed `resume_request.json` — picks up a /ulw task that a Claude Code rate-limit kill interrupted. `--dismiss` suppresses the SessionStart hint without resuming. Pairs with the SessionStart resume-hint hook (Wave 1) and the headless watchdog (Wave 3). |
| ulw-off *(deactivate)* | `/ulw-off` | Deactivate ultrawork mode mid-session |
| skills *(this list)* | `/skills` | List all available skills with usage guide |

> The mythology-named skills (atlas, metis, oracle, prometheus, librarian) carry one-word mnemonics — see [`docs/glossary.md`](docs/glossary.md) for the rationale behind each name.
>
> `/ulw` is the canonical user-facing name. The legacy aliases `/autowork`, `/ultrawork`, and `sisyphus` remain wired in the classifier for muscle-memory continuity but new prompts and docs should lead with `/ulw`. (v1.31.0 — naming consolidation.)

### Auto-routed vs. manual escape hatches

**You don't have to learn the slash commands.** Here's what runs without you typing anything:

| Tier | Mechanism | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| **Hook-fired (mandatory)** | Fires automatically — you can't bypass it | `quality-reviewer` before code stop; `editor-critic` for prose/source-doc edits; `design-reviewer` when UI-shaped changes are semantically design-relevant (including native UI); `excellence-reviewer` for broad/open, cross-surface-at-threshold, current-complex-plan, active Phase 8 wave-plan, or unknown-scope work |
| **Model-invoked (Claude Code native auto-load)** | Auto-loaded by Claude Code when the open files or prompt match a skill's frontmatter description; no router, no hook | `swiftui-pro` on SwiftUI work (vendored from `twostraws/SwiftUI-Agent-Skill`); `gamedev` on Unity/Godot/web game work |
| **Router-suggested (reasoning)** under `/ulw` | Injected as a directive when prompt signals match | `prometheus`, `quality-planner`, `quality-researcher`, `librarian`, `metis`, `oracle` |
| **Router-suggested (engineering)** under `/ulw` | Same mechanism — extended to engineering specialists in this release | `backend-api-developer`, `devops-infrastructure-engineer`, `test-automation-engineer`, `fullstack-feature-builder`, `ios-ui-developer`, `ios-core-engineer`, `ios-deployment-specialist`, `ios-ecosystem-integrator`, `abstraction-critic` |
| **Auto-dispatched on prompt pattern** | An entire workflow (multi-agent + gates) fires when the router detects the pattern | `/council` for broad project-evaluation prompts, the 9-section Design Contract on UI work |
| **Manual control/diagnostic** *(by design)* | You declare intent — auto-firing would be wrong | `/ulw-skip`, `/ulw-pause`, `/mark-deferred`, `/ulw-status`, `/ulw-time`, `/ulw-report`, `/ulw-off`, `/skills` |
| **Manual setup/audit** | One-time or occasional | `/atlas`, `/memory-audit`, `/test-audit`, `/ulw-demo`, `/omc-config` |

Most quality-boosting specialists are auto-suggested by the prompt-intent-router under `/ulw` based on prompt signals — `/ulw fix the auth bug` automatically nudges toward `oracle` for hard debugging, `librarian` for unfamiliar APIs, `quality-reviewer` before stop, and so on. You don't have to type `/oracle` to get Oracle — the slash command is the standalone escape hatch, not the only path in.

## Power-user setup

Once you've run `/ulw-demo`, watched the quality gates fire, and decided you trust the harness, you can remove Claude Code's per-tool approval prompts:

```bash
bash install.sh --bypass-permissions
```

This is opt-in. It skips Claude Code's built-in "allow this tool?" prompts so `/ulw` runs without interruption. The harness's quality gates (verification, reviewer dispatch, stop-guard) keep working — those are independent of Claude Code's confirmation layer. Switch back at any time by re-running `bash install.sh` without the flag.

Other install options:

```bash
bash install.sh --no-ios                # Skip iOS-specific agents
bash install.sh --model-tier=economy    # Inherit deliberators + Sonnet specialists; adaptive live routing
bash install.sh --model-tier=quality    # Execution agents on Opus; deliberators ride the session model (max quality)
bash install.sh --git-hooks             # Install post-merge auto-sync hook
bash ~/.claude/switch-tier.sh economy   # Switch tier post-install (from anywhere)
bash uninstall.sh                       # Cleanly remove the harness
```

`--git-hooks` installs a `post-merge` hook into this checkout's Git hooks
path (normally `.git/hooks/`; linked worktrees resolve to the shared hooks
directory) so `git pull` can detect bundle drift and remind you to re-run
`install.sh`. Set `OMC_AUTO_INSTALL=1` when merging to run the installer
automatically. The hook never overwrites a pre-existing non-oh-my-claude
`post-merge` hook.

### Recommended companion tools

These are independent, MIT-licensed tools that pair well with oh-my-claude. They are not bundled — install separately when relevant.

**[`ccusage`](https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage)** *(token + cost tracking, 14.7k stars)* — Parses Claude Code's local conversation logs and aggregates token usage and cost against a locked LiteLLM pricing snapshot. The 5-hour-block aggregation (`ccusage blocks`) matches Anthropic's actual rate-limit window. `ccusage statusline` is a Beta hook that renders compactly in Claude Code's statusline if you want cost visibility there.

```bash
bunx ccusage                      # one-shot: tokens + cost across recent sessions
bunx ccusage blocks               # 5-hour rate-limit-window aggregation
bunx ccusage statusline           # Claude Code statusline integration (beta)
```

Distributed as a native Rust binary via npm — `bunx`/`npx`/`pnpm dlx`/`pnpx`/Nix paths all work; no global install required. The 5-hour window matches Anthropic's rate-limit cap, so `ccusage blocks` is the most useful single command for "how close am I to the cap?". oh-my-claude already surfaces rate-limit headroom in the statusline and **native token-count tracking** in `/ulw-time`, `/ulw-status`, and `/ulw-report` (input/output/cache split main-thread vs sub-agent, with sub-agent role/model attribution — `token_tracking=on` by default); ccusage owns **dollar cost** aggregation. The division is deliberate: oh-my-claude tracks token *counts* without a pricing table that can drift, while ccusage tracks *cost* — complementary, not redundant.

**[`XcodeBuildMCP`](https://github.com/getsentry/XcodeBuildMCP)** *(iOS Xcode automation MCP, 5.7k stars, getsentry-maintained)* — MCP server exposing 82 manifest-driven tools grouped by workflow phase (build, test, simulator, device, debug, SwiftPM, scaffold, UI-automation). Recommended in the iOS agents (`ios-ui-developer`, `ios-core-engineer`, `ios-deployment-specialist`, `ios-ecosystem-integrator`) when executable Xcode operations beat shelling out via Bash.

```bash
npx -y xcodebuildmcp@latest mcp   # on-demand, no global install
npm install -g xcodebuildmcp      # global
```

Then add to Claude Code's MCP config per `https://xcodebuildmcp.com/docs/clients`. Requires macOS 14.5+, Xcode 16.x+, Node 18+. Sentry telemetry is on by default — opt out per `https://xcodebuildmcp.com/docs/privacy` if needed.

```

The suite is a maintained evidence portfolio, not an append-only score. New behavior needs fresh proof but not necessarily a new file: inspect current owners, extend or merge when possible, and retire only when a contract is gone or stronger retained proof is demonstrated. `/test-audit [scope]` returns an evidence table with `KEEP` / `EXTEND` / `MERGE` / `REPLACE` / `DELETE` / `ADD` decisions; pass `--apply` to implement proven changes. Test age, slowness, or always-green history alone never justifies deletion.

## Auto-resume after a Claude Code rate-limit kill

When Claude Code's 5-hour or 7-day rate-limit window expires mid-task, the session terminates with a `StopFailure`. By default the harness now captures the moment via three layers, so the work picks up "as if it were not interrupted" once the cap clears:

1. **Substrate (always on, privacy-aware)**. The `StopFailure` hook persists `~/.claude/quality-pack/state/<session>/resume_request.json` carrying the original objective, last user prompt, matcher, reset epoch, and project key. Set `stop_failure_capture=off` in `~/.claude/oh-my-claude.conf` to opt out of the capture (shared machines / regulated codebases).
2. **SessionStart hint (always on)**. The next time you open Claude Code in that project, a SessionStart hook surfaces the unclaimed artifact's objective and reset timing as `additionalContext`. Either invoke `/ulw-resume` to atomically claim and replay the original prompt, or `/ulw-resume --dismiss` to silence the hint without resuming.
3. **Headless watchdog (opt-in)**. A LaunchAgent (macOS), systemd user-timer (Linux), or managed crontab entry (fallback) runs every ~2 minutes. When a rate-limit window clears it atomically claims the artifact, then launches `claude --resume <session_id> '<original prompt>'` in a detached `tmux` session named `omc-resume-<sid>` rooted at the original cwd. Attach with `tmux attach -t omc-resume-<sid>`.

Activate the watchdog:

```bash
bash ~/.claude/install-resume-watchdog.sh
```

The installer detects your platform, registers the scheduler, sets `resume_watchdog=on`, and runs a dry-tick to confirm health. On launchd/systemd hosts it installs the native scheduler; on fallback hosts it writes a managed crontab entry when `crontab` is available and otherwise prints the exact line to add manually. Tail the log at `~/.claude/quality-pack/state/.watchdog-logs/resume-watchdog.log` (macOS) or `journalctl --user -u oh-my-claude-resume-watchdog.service -f` (Linux).

When `tmux` is not available the watchdog falls back to an OS notification — you click the alert, open Claude Code, and run `/ulw-resume` manually. For cron fallback hosts, inspect the managed entry with `crontab -l`. To uninstall the watchdog: `bash ~/.claude/install-resume-watchdog.sh --uninstall [--reset-conf]`.

## Release & distribution tooling (maintainers)

> Skip this section unless you cut releases. Nothing here is needed to install or use the harness — it is moved out of Quick Start on purpose.

Maintainers changing release/distribution automation can also prove that the remote default branch actually has the required workflow/tooling deployed with `tools/verify-release-automation-deployment.sh`, stage the exact audited deployment surface with `tools/stage-release-automation-surfaces.sh`, prepare a coherent pre-push deployment candidate with `tools/prepare-release-automation-deployment.sh --dry-run` and `tools/prepare-release-automation-deployment.sh --fetch`, inspect the raw staged diff with `tools/verify-release-automation-deployment.sh --local-ref INDEX`, and get the full top-level maintainer picture with `tools/verify-distribution-readiness.sh`. That distribution wrapper now separates the live remote deployment proof from the local deployment-candidate proof, so maintainers can see “candidate ready locally” even while `origin/main` is still behind. For first-run distribution quality, `tools/verify-install-readiness.sh` proves the bootstrapper/update path, fresh-install handoff, recovery-path transcript, and AI-assisted onboarding contract together. For the full release-candidate view, `tools/verify-project-readiness.sh` composes that distribution proof with the cross-domain product proof from `tools/verify-professional-readiness.sh` plus the install/onboarding proof from `tools/verify-install-readiness.sh`, so maintainers can see in one command whether the repo is actually ready for professional users, installable by first-time users, and ready to ship. That wrapper covers classification + routing + UI design contracts + benchmark + realwork + install/onboarding before it even reaches the remote release/distribution audit. The staging helper supports a dry-run preview, fails closed when unrelated files are already staged, and supports `--allow-extra-staged` when that wider staged set is intentional; when you narrow it with `--path`, it also fails closed if other manifest entries are still dirty unless you explicitly pass `--allow-partial-manifest`. The new deployment-candidate helper succeeds when that pending staged candidate is coherent even though the remote is still behind, which closes the old ambiguity where `--local-ref INDEX` necessarily failed before push. The staged-index deployment verifier now applies the same fail-closed posture to unrelated non-manifest staged paths unless you explicitly pass `--allow-extra-staged`, and `tools/verify-distribution-readiness.sh` passes that same override through when you audit the staged index via `--local-ref INDEX`. All three release/distribution audit helpers support `--json` when you need the same proof as a machine-readable artifact.
